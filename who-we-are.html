        <h2><u>SALVATION GUIDELINE</u></h2>
        <p> What is Salvation? 

Salvation means to save, rescue, or deliver from imminent danger. 

Sin made us enemies with God and due for his punishment which is eternal condemnation according to Romans 5:10 - “For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life and Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” 



Salvation is by Grace through Faith not works 

Ephesians 2:8-9 – “For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.” 



Decide to be born again 

The day of salvation is when you receive/hear the Gospel 

2 Corinthians 6:2 - “For he says, “In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.” I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation” 

Romans 10:10 - “For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.” 



Prayer for salvation 

Lord Jesus, I need you. I believe you died for me and that you rose from the dead. 

I confess you now as my Lord and Savior. Thank you for forgiving me of all my sins and making me your own. I will live for you the rest of my days. In Jesus Name I pray. 

Amen!
